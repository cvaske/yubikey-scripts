Purpose
=======

These scripts document my attempts to make the Yubikey 4 work with
both PKCS#11 SSH, PKCS#11 VPNs, and GnuPG, simultaneously.

The root directory holds the scripts that I would use to reinit a new
key.

As a novice when it comes to smart cards, I started writing these
scripts to try to make initialization of my new Yubikey 4 repeatable
and understandable. There are *many* failed attempts in the
`incomplete/` directory.

Dependencies
============

yubico-piv-tool
OpenSC (and the pkcs#11 library in /Library/OpenSC/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so)
